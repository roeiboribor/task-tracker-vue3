# vue-crash-2021

## Description
This project is based on https://github.com/bradtraversy/vue-crash-2021 to practice my skills on using basic VueJS 3 codes. As a aspiring Fullstack Developer I needed to harness my skill on both frontend & backend. I use laravel framework for my backend since I like manipulating data and use them into the system that provides analysis & organized data.
